<h3 id="Bithome">Bithome</h3>

<p><span>Warning: This user is the scammer behind many known sites as bitin, bithome and for sure a couple of unknown scams, too.</span>
<a href="https://bithome.co/">Bithome</a> scams users by offering to &quot;buy&quot; Bitcoin with PayPal, Skrill, MoneyGram, Western Union and SEPA / Wire transfer. Also users can &quot;sell&quot; Bitcoins, NOT.</p>

<p><strong>If you send any money, it will be gone and you will not hear back from them.</strong> In case of PayPal money is collected as &quot;friend+family&quot; payment and can not be charged back.
PayPal fraud team is aware, but did not do anything about it for months (01/2016). Additionally, the site uses Cloudflare and other technologies to cloak its origin. The contact address equals the one of bitin.co Scam.
