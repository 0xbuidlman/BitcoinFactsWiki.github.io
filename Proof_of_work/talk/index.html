<p>I think page should be renamed to &quot;Proof of work&quot;. There&#39;s no reason this has to be a hyphenated one-word. --<a>Nanotube</a> 08:02, 26 December 2010 (GMT)</p>

<p>Hey guys, love the project, love the idea.  The technical information on this page is fantastic and very interesting, but I think one critical focus that is missing from here and the main website is the <em>reason</em> why the &quot;Proof of work&quot; is important.  Why is there mining?  What purpose does it achieve?  How does it help give &#39;validity&#39; to the currency.  This important area should be explained as a general concept and have a heading of its own i think!  You&#39;ve covered the technical stuff well, but before that there should be the &#39;bigger picture&#39; explanation.  And maybe even on the main website?  It&#39;s the first question many people will ask.   Just my 2c <a>Manachi</a> 23:59, 19 May 2011 (GMT)</p></blockquote>
