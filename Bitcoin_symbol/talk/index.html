<h2 id="z-_has_relation_to_bitcoin">&#x3ED; has relation to bitcoin</h2>

<p><font>&#x3ED;</font> actually does have a visible relation to bitcoin, seeing as it is the lower-case russian B. :)</p>

<h2 id="Pros_and_cons_as_different_collums.3F">Pros and cons as different collums?</h2>

<p>I think it would be better if the pros and cons were in sepparate colums to make it easier to evaluate the proposals; what do you say? --<a>TiagoTiago</a> 15:23, 26 April 2011 (GMT)</p>

<h2 id="Removal_of_section_called_Existing_Unicode_symbol">Removal of section called Existing Unicode symbol</h2>

<p>Unless good reason are given, I would like to delete the section called &quot;Existing Unicode symbol&quot; <a>Pander</a> 12:04, 21 July 2011 (GMT)</p>

<ul>
<li>I object because B&#x20E6; is already more or less universally accepted (Bitcoin.org, Bitbills.com, Bitcoin Charts/Watch/OTC, etc) as the standard BTC symbol. Unicode isn&#39;t going to accept any new symbol for a niche currency, so anything new would be relegated to the PUA anyway. Let&#39;s stick to what works. In fact, even if Bitcoin were to get enough non-niche use, both &quot;submissions&quot; currently listed are basically just font variants of B&#x20E6;. --<a>Luke-jr</a> 17:01, 21 July 2011 (GMT)</li>
<li>I think it would be a good idea to get our own symbol, but as B&#x20E6; is already fairly universally accepted, it isn&#39;t a huge priority.  I think the Existing Unicode symbol section should stay.  I don&#39;t think though we should discard the two submissions based on them being stylized B&#x20E6;&#39;s.  I think they are sufficiently different from B&#x20E6; for our purposes. <a>Zellfaze</a> 15:37, 11 April 2012 (GMT)</li>

<h2 id="Unit_and_subunit_symbols">Unit and subunit symbols</h2>

<p>The proposal is to use existing unicode symbols. My preference is to use the unicode \u243 html &#x243; for bitcoin and the unicode \u289 html &#x289; for microcoin where 1 bitcoin = 1,000,000.00 microcoins
