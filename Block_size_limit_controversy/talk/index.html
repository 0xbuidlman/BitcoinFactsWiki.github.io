<p>I think the article needs a revision from the ground up since I think there is consensus that the limit should be increased, it is just unclear when to do that and by how much. Also, the &quot;A hard fork requires waiting for sufficient consensus.&quot; argument is actually very unclear because there is no measure of consensus short of the longest blockchain. Bitcoin core dev consensus is arbitrary and also represents a centralisation.  ---Unsigned comment by <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=User%3AChaosgrid&amp;from=Block_size_limit_controversy%2Ftalk" rel="nofollow">?</a>User:Chaosgrid</span></p>

<blockquote><p> (1) I agree there is widespread consensus that the limit should eventually be increased.  (2) I don&#39;t think the inability to independently measure consensus is a barrier to determining when a proposal does or does not have consensus.  When there are several important members of our community objecting to a proposal, it is safe to say that consensus has not been obtained.  ---<a>Harding</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Block_size_limit_controversy%2Ftalk&amp;page=User_talk%3AHarding&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 23:26, 10 August 2015 (UTC)</p>

<p> I think the positions can still be split, but not between never increase and increase now as it appears to be split at the moment. A more representative question to debate would be &quot;should the blocksize be increased in the near future&quot;. Near future may be defined as the next year and a half. Longest blockchain isn&#39;t guaranteed to be the consensus blockchain and the consensus required isn&#39;t between core devs, rather Bitcoin users. I think saying &quot;sufficient consensus&quot; is fine because there isn&#39;t a line between damage happening due to insufficient consensus and no damage happening. There are degrees of damage, with a 50% split being the worst and one small transaction being reversed due to someones broken consensus being the least bad, and 100% agreement being the perfect result. --<a>Lapp0</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Block_size_limit_controversy%2Ftalk&amp;page=User_talk%3ALapp0&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 05:05, 12 August 2015 (UTC)</p></blockquote>

<p>I removed the congestion and failing client arguments. The failing argument in particular has nothing to do with block size and everything to do with spam prevention. The congestion argument doesn&#39;t apply when replace by fee and child pays for parent exist. I left the high fee argument because it is the out of solving these two argued problems that were removed. --<a>Lapp0</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Block_size_limit_controversy%2Ftalk&amp;page=User_talk%3ALapp0&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 05:08, 12 August 2015 (UTC)</p>

<p>I also merged your feerate argument with its section in undecided arguments since it is already covered there partially, let me know if this isn&#39;t satisfactory. --<a>Lapp0</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=User_talk%3ALapp0&amp;from=Block_size_limit_controversy%2Ftalk" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 05:21, 12 August 2015 (UTC)</p>
