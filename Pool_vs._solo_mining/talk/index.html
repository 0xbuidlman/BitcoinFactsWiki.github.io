<p>There already had been the <a href="../../Why_pooled_mining/">Why pooled mining</a> article though this article provides different information through a different presentation.</p>

<p>Should the original be merged into this one? - <a>Sgornick</a> 02:36, 24 May 2011 (GMT)</p>

<p>This article seems biased toward a) pooled mining and b) eligius. This would be fine on a page like Why Pooled Mining. But since this page indicates it has pros/cons of both, there should be pros/cons of both. As is, it almost sounds like a commercial for eligius. --<a>Hawks5999</a> 19:04, 14 June 2011 (GMT)</p>

<p>Pooled mining is basically superior in every way nowadays, so there&#39;s not much one can do to avoid the &quot;biased&quot; feel. As for the Eligius bit, some other pool had a blatent advertisement in there, so I changed it to Eligius as a kind of &quot;backfired!&quot; expecting someone else to make it neutral fairly quick. --<a>Luke-jr</a> 22:04, 14 June 2011 (GMT)</p>

<p>&quot;Pooled mining is basically superior in every way nowadays&quot; is called an opinion. And when the opinion is given by someone who runs a pool, it is <em>ipso facto</em> biased toward pool mining. There&#39;s no problem with a biased opinion - every opinion is a bias by definition. However, for this content it seems it should be more fact and less commentary... and definitely not advertising. But, if I were in your position, I&#39;d likely do the same thing ;) --<a>Hawks5999</a> 23:20, 14 June 2011 (GMT)</p>

<p>Not really an opinion when there&#39;s hard facts behind it. I can&#39;t think of any good reason someone would solo mine anymore. --<a>Luke-jr</a> 20:58, 15 June 2011 (GMT)</p>
