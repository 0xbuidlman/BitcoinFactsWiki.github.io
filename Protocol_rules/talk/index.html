<h2 id="Transaction_override">Transaction override</h2>

<h3 id="Change">Change</h3>

<p>|Before|Tx |9 |Reject if any other tx in the pool uses the same transaction output as one used by this tx.
|After |Tx |9 |Reject if any other tx in the pool uses the same transaction output as one used by this tx, and has a greater or equal transaction fee</p>

<h3 id="Rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>When the default client sends a transaction without a sufficient transaction fee to complete, the coin ends up in limbo.  The default client won&#39;t allow spending of any of the input coins, but the network won&#39;t forward the coin to any neighbours.  This means that miners never add the coin to the chain.</p>

<p>This change would allow the client to re-send the transaction with an increased fee.  Clients which already saw the old transaction will still forward the new transaction, since it has a higher fee.  The client could even prompt the user about any transaction which has been pending for more than an hour or 2.</p>

<p>I think this proposal makes a lot of sense. Also, if someone did try to double-spend in a way that could be mined, but not gossiped on the network, then this would be bad.. I&#39;d far rather have the double-spend attempt gossiped, so that my wallet can see it and put a big question mark against the transaction!! --<a>Rebroad</a> 13:33, 8 April 2012 (GMT)</p>

<h2 id="Clarification_of_what_is_rejected_during_block_verification">Clarification of what is rejected during block verification</h2>

<p>With the sentences like &quot;For each input, if we are using the nth output of the earlier transaction, but it has fewer than n+1 outputs, reject&quot;, it&#39;s not clear what&#39;s being rejected: the input, the transaction, or the block.  Please could this be stated explicitly in each case.</p>

<blockquote><p>I thought it was pretty clear when I read this.  From a step entitled &quot;x verification&quot;, there are two possible results (ignoring side effects): &quot;x is accepted&quot; or &quot;x is rejected&quot;.  Therefore &quot;reject&quot; in such a step means to immediately follow the &quot;x is rejected&quot; branch.  Short answer: the block is rejected.  <a>Airbreather</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Protocol_rules%2Ftalk&amp;page=User_talk%3AAirbreather&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 00:50, 11 March 2014 (GMT)</p></blockquote>
