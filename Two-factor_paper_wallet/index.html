<p>I believe it was Casascius that <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=56414.0">first talked about the idea</a> of a &quot;2 factor paper wallet&quot;.  TL;DR - it&#39;s a system to securely generate BTC addresses given the risk of any particular machine being injected with trojans.</p>

<p>(If you can find the original discussion, that would be great)</p>

<p>See also <a>this BIP</a>.</p>

<h2 id="How_it_works">How it works</h2>

<ol>
<li>Trusted 3rd party generates a key pair (<em>Private_1</em>, <em>Public_1</em>), and sends them to you in the form of laminated paper. <em>Public_1</em> is derivable from <em>Private_1</em>. The keys are deleted after sending.</li>
<li>You generate an addition key pair (<em>Private_2</em>, <em>Public_2</em>) on your own machine.</li>
<li>You cryptographically combine <em>Public_1</em> and <em>Public_2</em> and get <em>Public_final</em> - a Bitcoin address.</li>
<li>You transfer BTC into <em>Public_final</em></li>
<li>At a later time, when you want to withdraw funds from it, you combine <em>Private_1</em> and <em>Private_2</em> to get <em>Private_final</em>, and withdraw.</li>
</ol>


<p>The point of the system is that an attacker would have to break into both your systems in order to withdraw funds. It is a way to securely store Bitcoins even if your system potentially contains trojans, without trusting a 3rd party. This scheme can in fact be done with N parties, with each additional part just adding security to the system (suspect Party1 is a CIA snitch? That&#39;s ok, because all it takes for this to be secure is one secure party).</p>
