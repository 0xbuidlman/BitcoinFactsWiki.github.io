<p>Accepting Bitcoins is easy, and there are several ways to do it.</p>

<h2 id="Manually">Manually</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download a bitcoin client</li>
<li>When a customer wants to buy something, send them a Bitcoin address where their payment should be sent.</li>
<li><ul>
<li>You can do this by clicking &quot;New..&quot; next to your address in the Bitcoin client and sending that address to the customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When payment comes in to that address, send the goods to your customer.  Depending on the value of what you&#39;re selling, you may wish to wait until the payment shows Confirmed.</li>
<li>To issue a refund, obtain from the customer the <a href="../Address/">bitcoin address</a> where the refund payment should be sent.  The refund address will likely be different from the address used when the customer sent payment, especially if an <a href="../EWallet/">EWallet</a> was used by the customer.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="Automated">Automated</h2>

<h3 id="Pre-generating_Bitcoin_addresses">Pre-generating Bitcoin addresses</h3>

<p>You can accept Bitcoins on your website without needing to use Bitcoin APIs or third party services if you pre-generate a large number of receiving Bitcoin addresses and store them in a database on your web server, and dispense them one-by-one to customers when they are ready to pay.  This way, your web server never actually handles the bitcoins - it simply gives out addresses belonging to a wallet you maintain elsewhere.  By using a unique address per order, you will always know which payment belongs to which order.  <a href="https://www.casascius.com">Example of website using this method</a></p>

<p>To pre-generate addresses, use a tool such as <a href="../Pywallet/">Pywallet</a> (which can generate a wallet.dat file) or <a href="../Bitcoin_Address_Utility/">Bitcoin Address Utility</a> (which can generate a CSV file).  In both cases, you will be generating a list of <a href="../Address/">Bitcoin address</a>es along with their corresponding <a href="../Private_key/">private key</a>s.  Only the Bitcoin addresses (not the private keys) should be loaded on the web server.</p>

<p>If you are shipping goods manually, you can use the Bitcoin software to check for incoming payments, or alternately consider using <a href="../Block_Explorer/">Block Explorer</a> or <a href="../Abe/">Abe</a> to verify payment when you&#39;re about to ship.  To make this easy, make your website provide you a full hyperlink that includes the proper receiving address:  http://www.blockexplorer.com/address/ADDRESSGOESHERE.</p>

<p>If you are delivering digital goods or services and want to be able to deliver instantly upon payment and/or confirmation, you can use a third-party service such as <a href="../Bitcoin_Notify/">Bitcoin Notify</a> to tell your website when a payment has been received.  This sort of service requires no significant API implementation - they will simply make a POST to your website or send you an e-mail when a payment has been received on one of your addresses.</p>

<p>If you keep Bitcoins off your web server, this ensures your wallet cannot be stolen if your web server experiences a security intrusion.  Your risk becomes limited to the possibility that a successful intruder could add his own addresses to your address pool and steal funds from a few incoming orders until you detect the problem, however, this is a <a href="../Deterministic_wallet/">relatively controllable risk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Using_offchain_payment_networks">Using offchain payment networks</h3>

<p><a href="../Off-Chain_Transactions/">Off chain</a> networks provides various benefits to Bitcoin, such as instant confirmations and protection against double spending.</p>

<h3 id="Using_a_third-party_plugin">Using a third-party plugin</h3>

<p>You can use an existing <a href="../tags/Shopping_Cart_Interfaces/">shopping cart interface</a> from a 3rd party to automatically handle all Bitcoin payments on your website.  If you want to develop the system yourself, you can utilize the Bitcoin client&#39;s <a href="../API_tutorial_(JSON-RPC)/">JSON-RPC API</a> to automatically accept payments.</p>

<p>Things to note if you build it yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>When a customer orders something on your website it records:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Bitcoin address that payment should be sent to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Order details (delivery address etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Customer&#39;s refund address (optional - if you wish you can ask for this later, only in cases a refund is required)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Payment amount</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When payment arrives, checks that they have paid the correct amount or not, and informs you</li>
<li><ul>
<li>You dispatch the goods to the customer and mark the order as fulfilled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>If you cannot dispatch the goods you mark the order as denied and ask the customer for a refund address (unless you already have it from earlier) to send a refund.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forwards the funds to bitcoin address of your choice</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="If_You_have_a_retail_business_and_do_not_have_internet_or_smart_phone">If You have a retail business and do not have internet or smart phone</h3>

<p>You can still accept Bitcoin. <a href="https://easybitz.com/merchant">(1)</a> EasyBitz.com has a very simple way to accept bitcoin with just a print out and a phone that gets sms text messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://easybitz.com/merchant"><img class="img" height="178" src="./400x400-Easybitz_bitcoin_pointofsale.png" title="EasyBitz ZeroClick System" width="400" /></a></p>

<h3 id="Businesses_that_mail_invoices">Businesses that mail invoices</h3>

<p>Does your business send out invoices to customers?  Adding one line may make a huge impact for the Bitcoin economy.  Perhaps you list it as a payment option just after Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, even if that means your customer must call or e-mail to make a payment. However it is possible to create automated invoices by using known payment systems supporting invoicing, and recurring invoice setup.</p>

<h2 id="Common_Errors">Common Errors</h2>

<p>It has been observed on occasion that a business funnels all its orders through the same Bitcoin address, and asks people to send some BTC, then send email describing the timing and the amount of the transaction to &#39;claim&#39; it. This is <strong>not</strong> secure, since anyone can see the transaction details using a tool such as <a href="../Block_Explorer/">Block Explorer</a>, and then try to claim someone else&#39;s transaction as theirs.</p>

<p>Do not do this.  Give each customer a unique Bitcoin address.</p>

<h2 id="Listing_your_business_on_the_Bitcoin_Trade_page">Listing your business on the Bitcoin Trade page</h2>

<p>Anyone can add and update a listing on the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Merchant_Howto&amp;do=create&amp;page=Trade" rel="nofollow">?</a>trade</span> page.  Just register if you haven&#39;t and add to the appropriate category.  If you&#39;ld like assistance, perhaps someone in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#bitcoin-marketing">#bitcoin-marketing</a> IRC channel would be willing to assist. If you have a brick and mortar business that accepts bitcoin you can add it to the bitcoin directories. <a href="https://easybitz.com">https://easybitz.com</a> <a href="http://coinmap.org">http://coinmap.org</a></p>
