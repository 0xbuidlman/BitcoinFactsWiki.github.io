<h2 id="Don.26.2339.3Bt_keep_your_computer_switched_on_overnight.">Don&#39;t keep your computer switched on overnight.</h2>

<p>Could you please elaborate on &quot;Don&#39;t keep your computer switched on overnight.&quot;. Mining is a common case for bitcoiners to leave on their pc over night.
Was the idea to not leave on the work pc where the &quot;cleaning lady&quot; might gain access?

<blockquote><p> Yes, also you are giving targeted attackers a lot of time to try out different ways to get into your system. --<a>Forever</a> 07:43, 29 June 2011 (GMT)
 Huh?? So your worry is that the PC is online +30% increasing the risk by 30%? Sorry but I would remove that point or change it to &quot;Don&#39;t allow physical access to strangers.&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t plug in any devices of doubtful origin.&quot;. If your system is well protected, time should not be an issue. (Maybe an inspiration: I know a guy who had a trigger at his server room door so whenever the door opened you had 60s to unlock the screen and stop the fully encrypted pc from shutting down. A camera was taping who entered the room to the pc&#39;s disc so he could check if it was the cleaning lady or strangers.)  --<a>Giszmo</a> 10:55, 29 June 2011 (GMT)
 Isn&#39;t the amount of uninterrupted time your computer is online also security issue? As for devices, that&#39;s another good Don&#39;t. I&#39;m going to add it. --<a>Forever</a> 06:36, 1 July 2011 (GMT)</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="Seems_like_the_moral_police_is_hard_at_work">Seems like the moral police is hard at work</h2>

<p>This guide was actually advising people NOT to install pirated software.  I don&#39;t see how this &quot;condones&quot; it in any way.  The debate about the morality of software piracy should be irrelevant here.  This is supposed to be a practical guide, and it is an unfortunate/fortunate (delete as appropriate to your ideological camp) fact of life that a significant proportion of computer users install <em>some</em> pirated software at <em>some</em> stage in their lives.  It is also a fact of life that pirated software is a popular vector for viruses.  Acknowledging this fact is no more an endorsement of piracy than it&#39;s an endorsement of illegal drugs when a hospital questions a patient about their illegal drug habits prior to performing an operation. --<a>Forever</a> 21:13, 5 November 2011 (GMT)</p>
