<p>The <strong>economic calculation problem</strong> is a criticism of using <a href="../Central_economic_planning/">central economic planning</a> as a substitute for <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=Market_%28economics%29&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>market-based</span> allocation of the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=factors_of_production" rel="nofollow">?</a>factors of production</span>. It was first proposed by <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Ludwig_von_Mises&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Ludwig von Mises</span> in his 1920 article &quot;<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Economic_Calculation_in_the_Socialist_Commonwealth&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth</span>&quot; and later expanded upon by <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=Friedrich_Hayek" rel="nofollow">?</a>Friedrich Hayek</span>. F. A. Hayek, (1935), &quot;The Nature and History of the Problem&quot; and &quot;The Present State of the Debate,&quot; in F. A. Hayek, ed. <em>Collectivist Economic Planning</em>, pp. 1&ndash;40, 201&ndash;43.</p>

<p>In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=subjective_value_theory" rel="nofollow">?</a>subjective values</span> are translated into the objective information necessary for <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=Rational_choice_theory&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>rational</span> allocation of resources in society.</p>

<p>In market exchanges, prices reflect the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=supply_and_demand&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>supply and demand</span> of resources, labor and products. In his first article, Mises focused his criticism on the inevitable deficiencies of the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=Socialization_%28economics%29&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>socialisation</span> of capital goods, but Mises later went on to elaborate on various different forms of socialism in his book, <em><span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Socialism_%28book%29&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Socialism</span></em>. Mises and Hayek argued that economic calculation is only possible by information provided through market prices, and that bureaucratic or technocratic methods of allocation lack methods to rationally allocate resources. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Economic_history&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>economic historians</span> as <em>The <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Socialist_Calculation_Debate&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Socialist Calculation Debate</span></em>. Mises&#39; initial criticism received multiple reactions and led to the conception of trial-and-error <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=market_socialism" rel="nofollow">?</a>market socialism</span>, most notably the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Lange__8211__Lerner_theorem&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Lange&ndash;Lerner theorem</span>.</p>

<p>Mises argued in &quot;Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth&quot; that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if a public entity owned all the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=means_of_production" rel="nofollow">?</a>means of production</span>, no rational prices could be obtained for <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=capital_goods&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>capital goods</span> as they were merely internal transfers of goods and not &quot;objects of exchange,&quot; unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily irrational, as the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently. He wrote that &quot;rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=commonwealth&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>commonwealth</span>.&quot; Mises developed his critique of socialism more completely in his 1922 book <em>Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis</em>, arguing that the market price system is an expression of <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=praxeology" rel="nofollow">?</a>praxeology</span> and can not be replicated by any form of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>However, it is important to note that central planning has been criticized by socialists who advocated decentralized mechanisms of economic coordination, including <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Mutualism_%28economic_theory%29&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>mutualist</span> <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</span>, <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Marxism&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Marxist</span> <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Leon_Trotsky&amp;do=create&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Leon Trotsky</span>, and <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=Anarcho-communism" rel="nofollow">?</a>anarcho-communist</span> <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Peter_Kropotkin&amp;from=Economic_calculation_problem" rel="nofollow">?</a>Peter Kropotkin</span> before the <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=Austrian_school&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>Austrian school</span> critique. Central planning was later criticized by socialist economists such as <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=Janos_Kornai" rel="nofollow">?</a>Janos Kornai</span> and <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;do=create&amp;page=Alec_Nove" rel="nofollow">?</a>Alec Nove</span>. <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=Economic_calculation_problem&amp;page=Robin_Cox&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>Robin Cox</span> has argued that the economic calculation argument can only be successfully rebutted on the assumption that a moneyless socialist economy was to a large extent spontaneously ordered via a self-regulating system of stock control which would enable decision-makers to allocate production goods on the basis of their relative scarcity using calculation in kind.  This was only feasible in an economy where most decisions were decentralised.  Trotsky argued that central planners would not be able to respond effectively to local changes in the economy because they operate without meaningful input and participation by the millions of economic actors in the economy, and would therefore be an ineffective mechanism for coordinating economic activity.</p>
