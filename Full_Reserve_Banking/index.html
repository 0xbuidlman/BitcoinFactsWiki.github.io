<p>A <span class="selflink">Full Reserve Banking</span> or 100% reserve banking system is one in which banks must hold reserves for 100% of on-demand liabilities. This means that should on-demand creditors all simultaneously ask for repayment, the bank will be able to honor all its obligations. This contrasts with a system of <a href="../Fractional_Reserve_Banking/">Fractional Reserve Banking</a>.</p>

<p>Term-deposits and other time liabilities are not limited by a full reserve banking policy. However the bank should plan to have enough reserves when their term expires and these debts become enforceable. &quot;<strong>The date on which the bank&#39;s obligations fall due must not precede the date on which its corresponding claims can be realized</strong>. Only thus can the danger of insolvency be avoided.&quot; (Ludwig von Mises. The Theory of Money and Credit. 1912).</p>

<p>In the Bitcoin world, inasmuch as exchanges have acted like banks by holding user Bitcoin balances, we have seen instances of <a href="../Fractional_Reserve_Banking/">Fractional Reserve Banking</a> practices and also bank-runs leading to insolvency. Most notably in the case of <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Mt._Gox&amp;do=create&amp;from=Full_Reserve_Banking" rel="nofollow">?</a>Mt. Gox</span>. Since then Bitcoin exchanges and other companies acting as Bitcoin custodians have started to offer cryptographic <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Proof_of_Reserves&amp;from=Full_Reserve_Banking" rel="nofollow">?</a>Proof of Reserves</span>, <a href="../Multisignature/">Multisignature</a> vaults, third party audits and other ways for users to verify that the company&#39;s Bitcoin liabilities in the event of insolvency do not exceed reserves.</p>
