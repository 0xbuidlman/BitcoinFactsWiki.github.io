<p><strong>Proof of Ownership</strong> is a method that uses Bitcoin&#39;s decentralized ledger (also called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain">blockchain</a>) or Bitcoin-related technologies to track the different owners of a certain information over the time.</p>

<p>This technique can be used by artists or businesses to certify the integrity, date of publication and ownership of their creations or contracts.</p>

<h2 id="Technology">Technology</h2>

<h3 id="Using_the_Bitcoin_blockchain">Using the Bitcoin blockchain</h3>

<p>The Bitcoin Core protocol now accepts raw data transactions up to 40 bytes per output using the opcode <strong>OP_RETURN</strong>.
Putting the hash of the signature of a file&#39;s hash in the blockchain makes the owner of the private key associated with the signature the owner of the file in the blockchain (as long as someone else doesn&#39;t show up with a proof certified before).</p>

<h3 id="Using_a_new_blockchain">Using a new blockchain</h3>

<p>It&#39;s also possible to create a new blockchain for this purpose. This blockchain wouldn&#39;t only store coins but also notarized proofs.</p>

<h2 id="Content_of_a_proof">Content of a proof</h2>

<h3 id="Ownership">Ownership</h3>

<p>Only the people with the private key associated with the signature can prove they are the owner.</p>

<h3 id="Existence">Existence</h3>

<p>A Proof of Ownership is always attached to a piece of data. Certifying the ownership of a certain information in the blockchain also proves that this information existed at a certain time.</p>

<h3 id="Integrity">Integrity</h3>

<p>A Proof of Ownership is always attached to a piece of data using cryptographic functions. This makes it impossible to alter the data after certification. If the content is modified, even by a single bit, then the whole certificate becomes invalid.</p>

<h3 id="Authenticity">Authenticity</h3>

<p>Because proofs are logged in the blockchain, it makes it easy to make transfers of ownership and find the original issuer of a certificate. Certificates can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">double-spent</a>&rdquo;.</p>
