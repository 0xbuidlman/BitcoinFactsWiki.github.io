<p>NOTE: This standard is used by <a href="../Namecoin/">Namecoin</a>, but new merged mining data should likely propose a new BIP to supercede it with something based on p2pool&#39;s merged mining.</p>

<h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (POW): a.k.a &quot;AuxPOW&quot;. This is the way that merged mining can exist; it is the relationship between two blockchains for one to trust the other&#39;s work as their own and accept AuxPOW blocks.</p>

<h2 id="Merged_Mining.3A_The_act_of_using_work_done_on_one_blockchain_on_more_than_one_chain.2C_using_Auxiliary_POW.">Merged Mining: The act of using work done on one blockchain on more than one chain, using Auxiliary POW.</h2>

<p>Auxiliary Blockchain: The altcoin that is accepting work done on alternate chains as valid on its own chain. Client applications have to be modified to accept Auxiliary POW.</p>

<h2 id="Parent_Blockchain.3A_The_blockchain_where_the_actual_mining_work_is_taking_place._This_chain_does_not_need_to_be_aware_of_the_Auxiliary_POW_logic.2C_as_AuxPOW_blocks_submitted_to_this_chain_are_still_valid_blocks.">Parent Blockchain: The blockchain where the actual mining work is taking place. This chain does not need to be aware of the Auxiliary POW logic, as AuxPOW blocks submitted to this chain are still valid blocks.</h2>

<p>Parent Block: Not to be confused with the &quot;previous block&quot;. This is a block that is structured for the parent blockchain (i.e. the <tt>prev_block</tt> hash points to the prior block on the parent blockchain). The header of this block is part of the AuxPOW Block in the auxiliary blockchain.
AuxPOW Block: This is a new type of block that is similar to a standard blockchain block, with two important differences. Firstly, the hash of the block header does NOT meet the difficulty level of the blockchain (so, if interpreted by a naive client, will be thrown out as not meeting the difficulty level). Secondly, it has additional data elements that show that the miner who created this block actually did mining activity (hashing) on the parent blockchain, and that work meets the difficulty level of the auxiliary blockchain, which is why this block should be accepted.</p>

<h2 id="Aux_proof-of-work_block">Aux proof-of-work block</h2>

<p>This is used to prove work on the auxiliary blockchain. In vinced&#39;s original implementation it&#39;s generated by calling the <tt>getworkaux</tt> RPC method on the parent blockchain client (<tt>bitcoind</tt>) and then the work is then submitted by passing it to the auxiliary chain client (<tt>namecoind</tt>) as the second parameter to <tt>getauxblock</tt>.</p>

<p>When receiving an Aux proof-of-work block in a <tt></tt><a href="../Protocol_specification/#block">&quot;</a>, the data received is similar to a standard block, but extra data is inserted between the <tt>nonce</tt> and <tt>txn_count</tt> elements. In the below table, the shaded rows are the same as the standard block definition:</p>

<p>For the <tt>coinbase_branch</tt> merkle branch, because the coinbase transaction is the first transaction in the block (if using Bitcoin as a parent chain, i.e. hash #7 in the example given <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=below__124__&amp;do=create&amp;from=Merged_mining_specification" rel="nofollow">?</a>below|</span>), the <tt>branch_side_mask</tt> is always going to be all zeroes, because the branch hashes will always be &quot;on the right&quot; of the working hash.</p>

<p>When only working on one auxiliary blockchain, the <tt>blockchain_branch</tt> link is not needed, and is nulled-out by being presented as 5 bytes of zeros (interpreted as a one-byte <tt>var_int</tt> indicating a <tt>branch_length</tt> of zero, and a 32-bit (4 byte) <tt>branch_side_mask</tt> of all zeroes).</p>

<p>Note that the <tt>block_hash</tt> element is not needed as you have the full <tt>parent_block</tt> header element and can calculate the hash from that. The current Namecoin client doesn&#39;t check this field for validity, and as such some AuxPOW blocks have it little-endian, and some have it big-endian.</p>

<h2 id="Merkle_Branch">Merkle Branch</h2>

<p>Say Alice created a Merkle tree, and it&#39;s root element is publicly available. For example:</p>

<pre>
             merkleRoot (0)
              /        \
             /          \
            1            2
           / \          / \
          /   \        /   \
         3     4      5     6
        / \   / \    / \   / \
       7   8 9  10  11 12 13 14
</pre>


<p>Now she wants to prove to Bob that a given hash (#10) was part of that tree, but Bob doesn&#39;t have the full tree (only the public root; hash #0). Alice can send Bob all the hashes she used to make the tree in the first place (hashes #7-#14, total of 7 extra hashes), so Bob can build the whole tree to verify the root is the same, but that&#39;s rather data-intensive. Instead, she could give Bob hashes #9, #3, and #2 (one from each level of the tree, working #10 back to the root). Without Bob knowing the structure of the tree, Alice also has to tell Bob what order to apply the hashes in (since <tt>hash(#9, #10) == #4</tt>, but <tt>hash(#10, #9) != #4</tt>). So Alice tells Bob &quot;left, left, right&quot; to indicate which operand #9, #3, and #2 are, respectively. That can be encoded as a bitmask and take up very little data to transmit. So, instead of transmitting 7 hashes to Bob, Alice transmits 3 hashes and a bitmask. The data savings get even more pronounced if the merkle tree gets even bigger.</p>

<p>That is the overall premise, and specifically for the AuxPOW protocol, it&#39;s been termed a &quot;merkle branch&quot; (since it&#39;s one pathway of a merkle tree), and is transmitted thus:</p>

<p>|? |branch_length |<a href="../Protocol_specification/#Variable_length_integer">var int</a>|The number of hashes making up the branch
|? |branch_hash[]|char<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=32&amp;do=create&amp;from=Merged_mining_specification" rel="nofollow">?</a>32</span>|Individual hash in the branch; repeated <tt>branch_length</tt>number of times
|4 |branch_side_mask |int32_t |Bitmask of which side of the merkle hash function the <tt>branch_hash</tt>element should go on. Zero means it goes on the right, One means on the left. It is equal to the index of the starting hash within the widest level of the merkle tree for this merkle branch.</p>

<p>The first <tt>branch_hash</tt> is used first, and the least-significant bit of the <tt>branch_side_mask</tt> determines its hash position. Then the second <tt>branch_hash</tt> is applied with the second-least-significant bit of the <tt>branch_side_mask</tt>, etc. So for Alice&#39;s example, <tt>branch_length</tt> would be 3, the hashes would be given in the order #9, #3, then #2, and the <tt>branch_side_mask</tt> would be <tt>0b011</tt> = 3 (equal to the index of #10 in the widest level of the merkle tree).</p>

<h2 id="Merged_mining_coinbase">Merged mining coinbase</h2>

<p>Insert exactly one of these headers into the <tt>scriptSig</tt> of the coinbase transaction in the parent block.</p>

|4 |merkle_nonce |int32_t |Nonce used to calculate indexes into aux work merkle tree; you may as well leave this at zero</p>

<p>That string of 44 bytes being part of the coinbase script means that the miner constructed the AuxPOW Block before creating the coinbase.</p>

<h2 id="Aux_work_merkle_tree">Aux work merkle tree</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re just mining a single auxiliary chain and using getauxblock, you don&#39;t have to worry about this - just set the merkle tree hash in the coinbase to the aux chain block&#39;s hash as given by getauxblock, the merkle size to 1, and the merkle nonce to 0. If you&#39;re mining more than one, this is a bit broken. It uses the following algorithm to convert the chain ID to a slot at the base of the merkle tree in which that chain&#39;s block hash must slot:</p>

<pre>unsigned int rand = merkle_nonce;
rand = rand * 1103515245 + 12345;
rand += chain_id;
rand = rand * 1103515245 + 12345;
slot_num = rand % merkle_size</pre>


<p>The idea is that you can increment merkle_nonce until the chains you&#39;re mining don&#39;t clash for the same slot. The trouble is that this doesn&#39;t work; because it just adds a number derived from the merkle_nonce to the chain_id, if two chains clash for one nonce they&#39;ll still clash for all possible nonces. (6.1) New implementers: please pick your chain_id so that not clashing with existing chains requires as small a value of merkle_size as possible, or use a better algorithm to calculate the slot id for your chain.</p>

<p>Once you know where in the merkle tree the different chains go, <em>reverse the bytes of each chain&#39;s block hash as given you by getauxblock</em> (so the byte at the start moves to the end, etc) and insert into the appropriate slot, filling the unused ones with arbitrary data. Now build up the merkle tree as usual by taking each pair of values in the initial row and double SHA-256 hashing them to give a new row of hashes, repeating this until you only have a single hash. This last hash is the merkle root. You need to <em>reverse the bytes of this again</em> before inserting it into the coinbase. If you&#39;re not using getauxblock to get the block hash, you can skip the first reversal but still need to reverse the final merkle root when adding it to the coinbase.</p>

<p>The aux proof-of-work also needs a merkle branch, which is built as follows: find the location of the block&#39;s hash in the merkle tree, and add the other value that you hashed it with in building the merkle tree. Now add the value you hashed that result with. Keep doing this until you reach the root. The merkle root itself is <em>never</em> included in the merkle branch. If you just have a single aux chain, this can be left entirely empty. (It also appears you <em>don&#39;t</em> need to reverse these hashes.)</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This is the AuxPOW block at <a href="http://explorer.dot-bit.org/b/19200">height 19200</a> in the Namecoin chain (the first block that allowed AuxPOW authentication). It has a hash of <tt>d8a7c3e01e1e95bcee015e6fcc7583a2ca60b79e5a3aa0a171eddd344ada903d</tt>, and only has one Namecoin transaction (coinbase sending 50 NMC to the miner&#39;s address). The parent block that was used as Proof of Work has a hash less than the difficulty target of Namecoin at the time, but not the Bitcoin target:</p>

<pre>
0000000000003d47277359fb969c43e3c7e7c0306a17f6444b8e91e19def03a9 -- parent block hash
000000000000b269000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 -- Namecoin difficulty target

</pre>


<p>Hence, this AuxPOW block was valid in the Namecoin blockchain, but not in the Bitcoin blockchain (you will find no Bitcoin block with the hash starting <tt>3d47277359fb969c</tt>. If it were, it would be right after <tt></tt><span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=4a59b7deb5c4e01b&amp;do=create&amp;from=Merged_mining_specification" rel="nofollow">?</a>4a59b7deb5c4e01b</span>, since that&#39;s the <tt>previous_block</tt> hash used)</p>
