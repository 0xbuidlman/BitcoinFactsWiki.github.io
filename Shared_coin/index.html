<p><strong>Shared Coin</strong> provides privacy for users&#39; <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Bitcoin_transaction&amp;do=create&amp;from=Shared_coin" rel="nofollow">?</a>transactions</span> by combining their transactions with other people&#39;s.</p>

<p>Shared Coin uses a technique similar to CoinJoin to make transactions private without needing to trust the Shared Coin service. A user&#39;s coins never leave their control and therefore it is impossible for them to be <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Bitcoin_Vulnerability&amp;from=Shared_coin" rel="nofollow">?</a>stolen or confiscated</span>.</p>

<h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>

<p> How does it work?</p>

<p>Shared Coin is a method of making transactions which requires less trust in the service. Shared Coin is based on the CoinJoin concept which acts as a meeting point for multiple people to join together in a single transaction. Having multiple people in a transaction improves privacy by making transactions more difficult to analyse. The important distinction between traditional mixing services is the server cannot confiscate or steal user&#39;s coins.</p>

<p> What logs are kept?</p>

<p>The server does not need to keep any logs and transactions are only kept in memory for a short time. However if the server was compromised or under subpoena it could be force to keep logs. If this were to happen although you haven&#39;t gained any privacy you haven&#39;t lost any either.</p>

<p> Are there any fees for shared transactions?</p>

<p>Shared Coin is a free service however a bitcoin network fee of 0.0005 BTC is required.</p>

<p> How long do shared transactions take?</p>

<p>Between 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on the number of iterations.</p>

<p> Is there a maximum transaction size?</p>

<p>The maximum transaction size is 50 BTC.</p>

<p>The user should also remember that Shared Coin can never completely <a href="../Anonymity/">sever the link</a> between the input and destination address, there will always be a connection between them, it is just more difficult to analyse.</p>
