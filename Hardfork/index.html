<p>A hardfork is a technical way to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol to include new
rules which can not be rolled out normally since they would make older clients
reject the new constructs used as invalid and &quot;not bitcoin&quot;.<br />
All users that want to continue using Bitcoin after a hardfork is accepted are
required to first upgrade to a version of their software which recognizes the new rules.</p>

<h2 id="Myths"><a name="index1h2"></a>Myths</h2>

<p>There are various myths about risks of hardforks. It is useful to address them head-on.</p>

<h3 id="Myth.3B_A_hardfork_can_cause_people_to_lose_bitcoins."><a name="index1h3"></a>Myth; A hardfork can cause people to lose bitcoins.</h3>

<p>Lets assume the change itself is not about people losing money, but the method of
deploying it is the one under discussion.
Users that didn&#39;t get the memo they need to update will, after the fork, end up not
getting any updates from the Bitcoin network any more. When a node gets no updates
it is much like not being connected to the internet.  You don&#39;t lose your coins that way.</p>

<h3><a name="index2h3"></a>Myth; A hardfork may cause miners to <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Chain_fork&amp;from=Hardfork" rel="nofollow">?</a>Chain fork</span> and two currencies will exist.</h3>

<p>There is no economic or practical reason to think this is true. While technically possible,
the people doing this would have to do so willingly and they would loose an immense amount
of money in the process. Which makes it practically and economically improbable.</p>

<p>Should a miner, or a group of miners, decide to not upgrade while the majority of the
miners did upgrade they would end up creating a <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Chain_fork&amp;from=Hardfork" rel="nofollow">?</a>Chain fork</span>. There are several problems
that those miners that are in minority will face;</p>

<ol>
<li>The network still assumes all miners on the chain, so they will have minority hashing power
and the rate at which they find blocks will slow down a factor of 10 or more. This directly
influences the usefulness of the chain. If no transactions are being processed users may
prefer to use the upgraded chain.</li>
<li>Miners mining on the minority chain will get paid in bitcoins that will have zero value
on the main chain. This is because they are unknown there. A miner mining on a minority
chain thus needs to find people willing to pay for his electricity bills otherwise.</li>
<li>Mining profits are not spendable until 100 blocks have been mined on top of it. Which is
normally about a day of mining. But due to point 1, it may take considerably longer.</li>
<li>All above points combine to make it uncertain to mine. Should a part of the miners mining
on the minority chain leave and go to the majority chain, they will make it even more difficult
for any of them left to get any payment for their work.</li>
</ol>


<p>The high risk and near certainty that you won&#39;t get paid for working on a minority chain
makes this myth totally busted.</p>

<h2 id="Safe_upgrade_process"><a name="index2h2"></a>Safe upgrade process</h2>

<p>A hardfork is a moment in time when the first transaction or block is accepted in the
network that formerly would not be accepted. An old client not aware of the new rules
would reject this new block or transaction. Before that point in time, there is no hardfork.</p>

<p>At the time of the hardfork, all the miners need to be running the new software version.
If they are not, they can&#39;t mine because they reject correct blocks made by other miners.
Also there need to be an amount of full-nodes in production that support the new rules.</p>

<p>A safe way to upgrade is thus to agree on a time in the future that is far enough away
to allow miners and various nodes to run the new version of the software. Make sure that
all the miners are aware of the actual switch-over date so they can prepare.</p>

<p>Typical solution is to pick a specific block-number or a specific date that is the point
where the new rules come into effect.</p>

<p>This way there is nobody left behind, and the upgrade will be completely safe.</p>
