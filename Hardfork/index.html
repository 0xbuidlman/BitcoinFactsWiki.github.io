<p>A hardfork is a way to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol to include new rules.
Older bitcoin software would mark transactions and blocks following these
new rules as invalid, which means that a hardfork requires everyone to
upgrade their software in order to continue being part of the Bitcoin
network.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, any fork changes the basic rules of Bitcoin. This can be a very
subtle rule but also a new payment type or something as big and fundamental as the
<a href="../Controlled_supply/">maximum amount</a> of bitcoins that can exist. This page
focuses on hardforking as a technique only.  The specific changes that can be done in a
hardfork are out of scope for this page.</p>

<h2 id="General_principles"><a name="index1h2"></a>General principles</h2>

<p>A hardfork picks one point in time after which new protocol-level rules
come into effect.
For instance a new type of transaction is allowed and validated after the
hardfork time.  All the old rules will still be valid and the entire
history recorded on the blockchain can still be validated. A client that
doesn&#39;t follow that rule will reject the new transaction type and thus
reject blocks including it. Which means it can no longer understand
Bitcoin. They will stop being part of the network.</p>

<p>Due the the nature of deployment (see below for details) all miners and all
full nodes that want to continue being part of Bitcoin need to run software
with the new Protocol rules.</p>

<p>The politics of getting all nodes to upgrade to the new version means that
a large range of the Bitcoin ecosystem has to agree with the change of
rules before it can be deployed. People that disagree with the rules can
avoid running software that enables the new rules and as long as there are
not enough supporting nodes and miners the upgrade of Bitcoin will not
happen.</p>

<h2 id="Risks"><a name="index2h2"></a>Risks</h2>

<p>A hardfork is a change in rules such that old clients no longer accept new
blocks made by miners following the new rules.  This has the effect that
old nodes reject the new blocks.  In the Bitcoin software this rejection is
typically accompanied by a disconnect and ban of the node that tried to
send the new block to the old node.  In very short term this will mean that
old nodes will be completely isolated from new nodes after a block was
mined that violates the old-nodes rules.<br />
A similar issue may exist when a new transaction type is introduced, a new
node relays a transaction that an old one doesn&#39;t thing is valid. Causing
a disconnect.</p>

<p>The result is the creation of two networks. One that follows all the new
rules and one that doesn&#39;t. Most of the risks involve this basic problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The risk is there if there are miners on the old rules still creating
blocks while new miners create new blocks.  This creates a <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=Chain_fork&amp;from=Hardfork" rel="nofollow">?</a>Chain fork</span>.
Various scenarios are possible depending on the amount of luck and amount
of hashpower on each side.  The risk itself is based on the fact that we
can&#39;t predict what kind of reorganizations will happen.  It is typically
best to wait for more confirmations in the hours that a fork is scheduled
to take place.</p></li>
<li><p>There are not enough (non-miner) nodes to support the new rules.  This
in reality is unlikely to be an actual issue because miners user a separate
relay network.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2 id="Safe_upgrade_process"><a name="index3h2"></a>Safe upgrade process</h2>

<p>A hardfork is a moment in time when the first transaction or block is accepted in the
network that formerly would not be accepted. An old client not aware of the new rules
would reject this new block or transaction. Before that point in time, there is no hardfork.</p>

<p>At the time of the hardfork, all the miners need to be running the new software version.
If they are not, they can&#39;t mine because they reject correct blocks made by other miners.
Also there need to be an amount of full-nodes in production that support the new rules.</p>

<p>A safe way to upgrade is thus to agree on two things;</p>

<ol>
<li>That the majority of the community wants this hardfork.</li>
<li>What point in time to pick after which the new rules will be
operational.</li>
</ol>


<p>There are multiple ways we have seen this being done in the past. The simplest
by far is to have some discussions and then in all the software decide on a
block-number that introduces the new rules.  This is possible for upgrades
that everyone will accept without issues and are planned a considerable
amount of time in the future.</p>

<p>Another solution is to use BIP9 voting for the upgrade. Good example of a
safe way to do this is the way that BIP109 was introduced with
<a href="../Bitcoin_Classic/">Bitcoin Classic</a>. The design is that miners can choose to support the
feature by signaling a bit in each block they mine. If 750 out of 1000
blocks have this bit this means that a very generous super-majority of the
hashing power has this feature running.  After the required count is hit
another 4 weeks has to go by before the new rules go into effect.
This is to allow anyone in Bitcoin to upgrade their software if they
haven&#39;t done so yet.</p>

<p>This way there is nobody left behind, and the upgrade will be completely safe.</p>

<h2 id="Myths"><a name="index4h2"></a>Myths</h2>

<p>There are various myths about risks of hardforks. Issues people see as
risks, but in reality are not.</p>

<h4 id="Myth.3B_Two_currencies_will_exist."><a name="index1h4"></a>Myth; Two currencies will exist.</h4>

<p>This is based on the existing risk where there is mining power on both the
old and the new side of the hardfork. The myth states that the amount of
mining power will stay spread over both sides for such a long time (weeks)
that we have to take both sides seriously.</p>

<p>Economics and indeed practical considerations make this story to be so
highly unlikely that it is fine to disregard this myth to the bin of
irrational fears.</p>

<p>Should a miner, or a group of miners, decide to not upgrade while the majority of the
miners did upgrade they would end up creating a <span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=Hardfork&amp;page=Chain_fork" rel="nofollow">?</a>Chain fork</span>. There are several problems
that those miners that are in minority will face;</p>

<ol>
<li>The network still assumes all miners on one chain, so they will have minority hashing power
and the rate at which they find blocks will slow down relative to their
percentage of hash power. So if 10% of the hashpower is on the minority
chain, it will take on average 100 minutes, instead of 10, to find a block.
The bi-weekly change of difficulty won&#39;t come
every 2 weeks anymore. It will take much longer.</li>
<li>With blocks not coming very regularly, the transaction backlog will
grow. Notice that the transactions being sent on the main chain will be
eligible for mining on the minority chain as well, causing this backlog to
grow even faster.  A larger backlog will make users unhappy and they may
switch to the main chain even if they dislike the new policies.</li>
<li>Miners mining on the minority chain will get paid in bitcoins that will have zero value
on the main chain. This is because they are unknown there. A miner mining on a minority
chain thus needs to find people willing to pay for his electricity bills otherwise.</li>
<li>Mining profits (coinbase) are not spend-able until 100 blocks have been
mined on top of it, as part of the protocol rules. 100 blocks is normally
about a day of mining. But due to point 1, it may take considerably longer.</li>
<li>All above points combine to make miners uncertain of getting payment on
the minority chain.  On the main chain, however, their mining power can
generate coins that actually can be used as payment later on.  If some
miners leave they make the situation worse for everyone else on the
minority chain.</li>
<li>The last to leave the minority chain is the bag-holder. They get to pay
all the unpaid bills and end up losing the most.</li>
</ol>


<p>The high risk and near certainty that you won&#39;t get paid for working on a minority chain
makes this myth totally busted.</p>
