<p>A term <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130222.msg1392450#msg1392450">coined by Meni Rosenfeld</a> for the following miner policy:</p>

<pre><code>Ignore alternate chains if they contradict more than N blocks of history known to this miner.
</code></pre>

<p>This proposal is a possible way to combat double spends. If honest miners cement each block N blocks after it is received, an attacker has a deadline of N blocks for the release of his alternate chain that contains the double spend transaction (this in opposed to without cementing, where an attacker can theoretically wait a very long time while building his alternate chain, in the hopes of winning the race to build the longest chain.</p>

<h2 id="Potential_Problems">Potential Problems</h2>

<p>Cementing has some potential problems, and might not be good in practice. From the thread linked above by Meni:</p>

<p>**I call this practice &quot;cementing&quot; and it has some problems, similar to what we would have if there was no blockchain at all. The basic idea is that a node could be stuck on &quot;the wrong version&quot; after being isolated and fed bad data from an attacker, and would have no way to recover even after being exposed to the honest network.</p>
