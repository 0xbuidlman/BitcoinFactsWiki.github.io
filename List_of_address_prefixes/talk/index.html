<p>What is the policy regarding addresses which are not altcoins but which relate to protocols being built on top of bitcoin? I think there is value in some kind of registry for such protocols to prevent address clashes, and help users know the purpose of different addresses. But I don&#39;t want to overstep if that&#39;s not the purpose of this page.

<li>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by that. Altcoins abusing bitcoin&#39;s blockchain are still altcoins. Also note that the version byte is for a version, not a namespace. CoinSpark seems to be inserting a &quot;features&quot; in the address. It makes sense to have this, I think, but it should be based on version 5 addresses (p2sh), not the obsolete version 0 (p2pkh)... Perhaps more importantly, this should be proposed on the development mailing list and made a BIP before appearing on this page. --<a>Luke-jr</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?from=List_of_address_prefixes%2Ftalk&amp;do=create&amp;page=User_talk%3ALuke-jr" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 20:47, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>CoinSpark is not an altcoin. It&#39;s a protocol for enriching bitcoin transactions via OP_RETURNs. Of the 5 features on the current roadmap, one is a variant on the idea of colored coins (I don&#39;t know if you would call that an altcoin or not) but the rest are all about making regular bitcoin transactions easier and more useful. I imagine it will be one of many such protocols which come out during the coming years, and I think there is sense in avoiding addressing clashes between these different protocols. As you say, <a href="http://coinspark.org/developers/coinspark-addresses/">CoinSpark addresses</a> encode several types of information but this is not really appropriate for a BIP since it&#39;s not an enhancement to the bitcoin protocol itself. (Think TCP/IP and the Web.) So what mechanism would you suggest for avoiding addressing clashes? <a>Gidgreen</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=User_talk%3AGidgreen&amp;from=List_of_address_prefixes%2Ftalk" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 06:28, 20 July 2014 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If it&#39;s not Bitcoin, it doesn&#39;t belong on the Bitcoin Wiki or in the Bitcoin blockchain. If it is Bitcoin, then a BIP is appropriate. BIPs are for any Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, not just select parts of the system. --<a>Luke-jr</a> (<span class="createlink"><a href="/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;page=User_talk%3ALuke-jr&amp;from=List_of_address_prefixes%2Ftalk" rel="nofollow">?</a>talk</span>) 17:58, 20 July 2014 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems odd that keys (HD and WIF) are listed in a table of &quot;address prefixes&quot;.
